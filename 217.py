# 217. Contains Duplicate

# Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

# tricky version: use python if _ in _ to test 
# for every element of the array 
# store that element to x
# set that element to None
# if x in array: if true then retun true
# if you get to the end of the array, return false

# this exceeds the time limit if nums is really big

# def containsDuplicate(nums):
#     x = None
#     for i in range(len(nums)):
#         x = nums[i]
#         nums[i] = None
#         if x in nums:
#             return True
        
#     return False


# this is faster, but not fast enough

# def containsDuplicate(nums):
#     x = None
#     # start at the end
#     i = len(nums) - 1
#     while i > 0:
#         x = nums[i]
#         nums.pop(i)
#         i -= 1
#         if x in nums: return True
#     return False


# make an array called seen.
# If num is not in seen, add it to the array then keep going
# if is in seen, return true
# if you get to the end of the loop return false

# def containsDuplicate(nums):
#     seen = []
#     for num in nums:
#         if not num in seen:

#         else: 
#             return True
#     return False

# nums = [1,2,3,4]

# experimental approach
# cut the array into smaller pieces of size two
# do any pieces contain repeats? 
    # if yes: return true
# if no: add every two peices together
    # check again: 

# this doesn't work but points for trying
